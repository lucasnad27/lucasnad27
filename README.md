# Operating Instructions for Lucas

Below you'll find a collection of guiding principles, tools, and frameworks. Pretty much anything that has helped me build up the skaffolding for my personal & professional aspirations.

## First Principles for Life & Work
1. Practice simulated annealing. Frontload randomness early and slowly temper yourself into an optimal, stable state.
2. Do not assume you are in a global maxima or minima. It could be better. It could be worse.
3. There are less zero-sum games than we think. Try not to play them.
4. Hindsight is 10/20. A single moment: past, present, or future cannot be seen for what it truly is. Only by combining a multitude of perspectives can we get _close_ to perfect vision. Never stop trying to improve your vision.
5. Pessimists complain about the future. Optimists build it. Be optimistic.

## Organizational Tools

- [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) - A tool born out of the necessity of managing multiple people & projects
- [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) - A structured way to have an ongoing conversation with myself
- [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) - Keep track of internet articles. Great for reading/highlighting & JIT search capabilities.
- [Readwise](https://readwise.io) - Surfaces highlights from my kindle and pocket. Reinforces learning through spaced-repition.
- [Anki](https://ankiweb.net) - The holder of all my knowledge. I try to add at least one new flashcard every day and review every day. Increases the size of my brain's RAM ;) Reinforces learning through spaced-repition.
- [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) - This is where I keep track of all the books I've read and want to read. Great Kindle integration. [My profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46032879-lucasnad27) if you're so inclined.

## Developer Awesome

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - I've tried them all. And this is my favorite.
- [VSpaceCode](https://vspacecode.github.io) - Gets VSCode to be as keyboard-centric as SpaceMacs + Emacs did for me back in the day.
- [Magit](https://magit.vc) - I've tried them all. Magit wins hands down. The git CLI comes in a close second.
- [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh) - Immediately 5x your terminal proficiency by installing a tool like ohmyzsh or bashit setup. Works across MacOSX and Linux. Windows...YMMV.

## Frontend Awesome
A collection of my go-to tools for frontend development
- [Svelte](http://svelte.dev) + [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) - Managing state and updating the dom just make sense with this no nonsense framework. More intuitive than React in my opinion, although I stil love React
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - utility-first CSS framework that reduces my urge to gouge my eyeballs and throw my laptop out the window

## Backend / Data Science Awesome
A combination of backend and data science resources
- [Advanced Python Testing](https://joshpeak.net/posts/2019-06-18-Advanced-python-testing.html) - I come back to this article again & again when building test pipelines and best practices.
- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Enables code reviews to get past, _"you should use my stylistic opinion"_
- [Dramatiq](https://dramatiq.io/index.html) - Preferred async task processing library.
- [Gym](https://gym.openai.com) - Any tool that makes ML, in any of its shapes, more accessible, I'm a big fan of.
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) - See the above comment ^^
